@article{Wade1993,
abstract = {Banana (Musa, AAA) bunch-sections consisting of one hand attached to a short section of main-stalk were wound-inoculated with cultures of fungi isolated from diseased fingers, crowns, or main-stalks and stored in sealed polyethylene bags containing 3-7% oxygen, 10-13% carbon dioxide and <0.1 $\mu$l l-1 ethylene for 40 days at 20°C, then ripened with ethylene in air for nine days. Colletotrichum musae, Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans and Nattrassia mangiferae caused high infection incidence in unripe fingers during storage. These fungi also caused crown rot, but only F. moniliforme var. subglutinans caused main-stalk rot. Alternaria alternata and F. pallidoroseum both caused some infection in unripe fingers during storage, and both subsequently caused crown rot. A. alternata also infected main-stalks. Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Phomopsis musicola infected only ripening fingers, and F. culmorum infected only crowns and main-stalks. The pathogenicity of some isolates was changed by interposing storage between inoculation and ripening. C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides became unable to cause disease and F. culmorum caused less disease. In contrast, A. alternata and F. pallidoroseum became pathogenic to fingers, crowns and, in the case of A. alternata, to bunch main-stalks. Benomyl and prochloraz (500 mg l-1) controlled most diseases at inoculation sites, and naturally-occurring main-stalk rot. Prochloraz controlled more diseases than benomyl, and this control was usually more effective. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Alvindia2008,
abstract = {Fungi isolated from the surface of banana fruits were evaluated for in vitro antagonism towards Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Thirteen fungi exhibiting pronounced growth inhibition of test pathogens were further tested for antibiosis against Thielaviopsis paradoxa, Colletotrichum musae, and Fusarium verticillioides. Clonostachys byssicola, Curvularia pallescens, Penicillium oxalicum, and Trichoderma harzianum were antagonistic to all test pathogens. Inhibition by C. pallescens and P. oxalicum to pathogens was at a distance, while C. byssicola and T. harzianum directly parasitized and killed the pathogens. The metabolites of C. byssicola, C. pallescens, and T. harzianum significantly affected the mycelial growth and conidial germination of the pathogens. In the artificial inoculation study, the antagonists survived and colonized banana fruits after 3 d. Interfungal parasitic relationship was observed between the antagonist and pathogen on artificial media and natural substrate. Postharvest application in the packing house showed that the incidence of crown rot in antagonist-treated banana was significantly lower when compared to fungicide and untreated control fruits. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The article discusses several studies concerning the development of crown rot in bananas and its symptoms. It states that crown rot mainly affects the tissues of the plant which unites the peduncles and it usually appear after maritime shipping. It notes that it is the major cause of income loss to its producers including in Great Britain, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. It cites the potential factors which caused the incident including artificial fruit ripening, storage and seasonal variations.},

@article{Chawla2002,
abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally rep- resented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting)example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (nor- mal)class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal)class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC)and the ROC convex hull strategy},
